There will be 2 file structures for the jobs. A local structure and a cloud structure. The local structure will be used by the extension to create jobs. The local agent will watch and read the local structure and then create a corresponding job with VM allocations in the remote structure. The remote agent will pull from the remote structure and execute jobs on the local VM.
