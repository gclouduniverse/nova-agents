There will be 2 file structures for the jobs. A local structure and a cloud structure. The local structure will be used by the extension to create jobs. The local agent will watch and read the local structure and then create a corresponding job with VM allocations in the remote structure. The remote agent will pull from the remote structure and execute jobs on the local VM. 

Local Structure:
   jobs/
     |__<job1_id> ( A unique ID created by the extension)
     |       |_ config.yaml  (YAML file describing the job config)
     |       |_ <my_notebook>.ipynb ( Notebook file to submit)
     |__<job2_id>    ....
     
 Remote Structure:
   jobs/
     |__<job1_id> 
     |       |_ machine1 (machine name that should do the job)
     |            |_ <my_notebook>.ipynb  (Notebook file to execute)
     |            |_ RUNNING              (An empty file marking that the job is already running)
     |            |_ DONE                 (An empty file marking thet the job is complete)
     |            |_ <my_notebook>.nbconvert.ipynb ( output notebook file)
     |       |_ machine2 ...
     |
     |__<job2_id>    ....
     
     
 config.yaml format:
 
  machine_type: n1-standard-8 (or any of the types in https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types)
  count: 1 ( number of gce instances to create. minimum is 1)
