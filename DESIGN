There will be 2 file structures for the jobs. A local structure and a cloud structure. The local structure will be used by the extension to create jobs. The local agent will watch and read the local structure and then create a corresponding job with VM allocations in the remote structure. The remote agent will pull from the remote structure and execute jobs on the local VM. 

Local Structure:
   jobs/
     |__<job1_id>.yaml (YAML file describing the job config)( <job1_id> A unique ID created by the extension)
     |       
     |__<job2_id>.yaml   ....
     
 Remote Structure:
   jobs/
     |__<job1_id> 
     |       |_ machine1 (machine name that should do the job)
     |            |_ <dir>                (dir with content from the <dir> attribute in job config file)
     |            |_ <job1_id>.yaml       (job config file)
     |            |_ RUNNING              (An empty file marking that the job is already running)
     |            |_ DONE                 (An empty file marking thet the job is complete)
     |            |_ <my_notebook>.nbconvert.ipynb ( output notebook file)
     |       |_ machine2 ...
     |
     |__<job2_id>    ....
     
     
 config.yaml format:
 
  machine_type: n1-standard-8 (or any of the types in https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/machine-types)
  machine_count: 2 ( number of gce instances to create. minimum is 1)
  gpu_type: nvidia-tesla-p100
  gpu_count: 1
  notebook: relative/path/to/<my_notebook>.ipynb ( Notebook file to submit)
  dir: dir/to/copy ( The directory that contains the above path.
  zone: us-west1-b ( machines zone. If not present, we will use notebook machine zone)
